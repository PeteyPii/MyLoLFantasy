Fork the repo, make sure that you have the latest changes, then branch off the `development` branch. Make your changes. Send a pull request
into the original repo's `development` branch and wait for us to review it and hopefully accept it.

Things we like to see are:
- Commit messages in the past tense (e.g. "Fixed problem x" or "Implemented feature y").
- Branch name in snake case.
- If you're working on a relevant issue from GitHub, precede commit messages and branch names with the issue number (e.g. I25_branch_name or "I25: Commit message").
- Follow the coding styles we already use.
